# Puppet modules but match the puppet- pattern
# The modules in the list are broken, unfinished or got migrated
# (yes, that really happens from time to time)
# ToDo: extend this list with repos that are archived on github
# ToDo: Archive repos that we migrate away
legacy_or_broken_nobody_knows:
  - puppet-bacula
  - puppet-nagios_providers
  - puppet-iis
  # Actually a gem
  - puppet-syntax
  - puppet-blacksmith
  # Actually an emacs plugin
  - puppet-mode

# define some versions that we want to match against
